# Homework: Note Taker

## Description
The following application allows a user to take notes using Express.  When a user
goes to the following website [Note Taker](https://immense-dusk-60188.herokuapp.com/), the user can click on the "Get Started" button to create, view, save, and delete notes.


## Technologies
This application uses the following: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and UUID.  This application was also deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).


## Experiences
Building this application was a neat experience.  Being able to see the completed application was great because it felt like what a full-stack developer would be doing; it was nice to see the front-end and back-end working together.  One fo the challenging parts of the activity was getting the DELETE request to work.  I ended up using Google to research the particular problems I was having when trying to figure out how to get the DELETE request to work.  This homework also helped me to better understand how the front-end and back-end work together.
